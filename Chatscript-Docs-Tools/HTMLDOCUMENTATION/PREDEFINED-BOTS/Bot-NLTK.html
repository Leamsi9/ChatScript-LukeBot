<h1 id="bot-nltk---natural-language-analysis-bot">Bot NLTK - Natural Language analysis bot</h1>
<p>ChatScript comes with a bot used to analyze documents called NLTK. You build it using `<code>:build nltk</code> It's still in its infancy.</p>
<p>You start by selecting what you want to do: <code>tally rootpos</code> – read documents and list all words in it and their frequencies by root and part of speech. The sentence I have loved animals since I was a boy will show</p>
<pre><code>2 = I~pro
1 = have~aux
1 = animal~n
1 = since~con
1 = be~v
1 = a~det
1 = boy~n</code></pre>
<p>though not necessarily in that order. You can then sort the output log file to find most common words. Note that <em>I have loved love</em> will list <code>love~n</code> and <code>love~v</code> separately since their part of speech usage was different.</p>
<p><code>tally root</code> – read documents and list all words in it and their frequencies by root. No part of speech information is provided so <em>I have loved love</em> will display 2 = love.</p>
<p><code>tally raw</code> – read documents and list all words in it and their frequencies as given. Swims and swim are two separate listings.</p>
<p>By default it displays all words. If you add min 2 after some command, then any word displayed must be found at least twice.</p>
<p><code>sentiment</code> – read incoming sentences or documents and display the sentence with a summary of + and – affect at start and pluss and minuses after words that have affect.</p>
<p><code>reset</code> – turn off existing mode, in preparation for changing to a new mode. For document reading, you would name the file or directory to read like this:</p>
<p><code>:document REGRESS/moby_dick.txt</code> - to read a file relative to top level ChatScript <code>:document READER/BOOKS/</code> - to read some directory relative to top level ChatScript</p>
<p>Tallying on a big document can take a moment, so the system outputs a . every 1000 sentences it reads.</p>
