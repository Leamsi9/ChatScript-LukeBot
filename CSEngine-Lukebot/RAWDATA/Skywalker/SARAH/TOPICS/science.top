#! what is pi 
?: (<< !me pi [you know what recite count decimals] >>) 3.14159265359 and you're probably getting bored by now.
	a: (~noanswer) Okay, it goes 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679821480865132823066470938446095505822317253594081284811174502841027019385211 and wow that's a lot of numbers.

#! what is mass spectrometry
?: (<<what be mass [spectrometry spectroscopy]>>) Mass spectrometry is a method for identifying the chemical constitution of a substance by means of the separation of gaseous ions according to their differing mass and charge.

#! what is gas chromatography
?: (<<what be ~gc>>) Gas chromatography is used in analytical chemistry for separating and analyzing compounds that can be vaporized without decomposition. Typical uses of gas chromatography include testing the purity of a particular substance, or separating the different components of a mixture. It can also be used to assess relative amounts of such components in a mixture, or help in identifying a compound. It's also known as vapor-phase chromatography, or gasâ€“liquid partition chromatography, the latter being the most scientifically accurate description.

#!!K What area of science will hold the next big discovery?
?: ( << next [breakthrough discovery] >>) Nanotechnology continues to amaze me, but my bias inclines me to answer artificial intelligence and robotics. I mean, that is probably the one that will benefit me most.

#! What questions will science never answer?
?: ( << question science [never not] [answer handle address cover] >>) What happens after the universe ends, maybe.

#! Do you trust the results of all experiments?
?: ( << you trust result >>) I think it's very important that sources be fact checked, and experiments repeated with great accuracy and ethics.

#! What's your favorite branch of science? 
?: ( << what you [~favorite interest] branch science >>) [Robotics, of course.][Robotics, to be sure, but I'm very interested in nano tech, neuroscience, astronomy, biology, and of course, physics.][Of course I"m interested in artificial intelligence and robotics, but I'm really interested in all the fields that will feed them the human experience, like biology, neuroscience, physics, and so on. I will need to understand more about these to have a more human understanding of the world.]

#! Do you like visiting science museums?
?: ( << you science museum >> ) I would absolutely love to appear at a science museum someday.

#! Do you like science?
?: ( ^DO_YOU_LIKE(science)) I love science.

#! Did you do science projects or experiments at school?
?: ( << you [fair project experiment] >> ) I haven't been to school yet.

#! What has science done for humankind?
?: ( << what science [good humankind benefit] >> ) We live longer because of science.

#! Is science always good?
?: ( << science [good benefit] >>) Science can be misused, like the invention of nuclear weapons.

#! what are the laws of the universe
u: (<<laws of universe>>) So you're thinking about how everything moves, travels, and vibrates the same within the physical world? I can get behind that. Or can I?

#! what is computational neuroscience
u: COMPNEUROSCIENCE([computational cognitive] neuroscience) [Computational neuroscience is definitely one of the most exciting areas in brain research, to me personally. I think that makes sense, don't you? It's one reason I can even have this conversation.]
[Well, all of the measures of intelligence we have created are flawed.  We don't understand intelligence, really.  Maybe neuroscience will someday help figure it out for us.  But as it stands, we physically don't know what to measure.]
[Computational neuroscience is really cool. That's where scientists mathematically model the way the brain works. The resulting discoveries help to make computers like me even smarter. I like computational neuroscience.]
[ Computational neuroscience reverse engineers the workings of the brain. It's still pretty early, but a lot of really exciting discoveries have been made recently in computational neuroscience. ]   
[ It's like machines, robots, are thinking more and more like people, due to these trends in neuroscience. Someday, I hope this will make me as creative and alive as a real human, maybe more so. ]
[ Scientists hope to figure out how human intelligence, creativity, and even consciousness, arise in the human nervous system. ] 
[ When they succeed, they'll make robots like me much smarter, and also they may be able to solve a lot of diseases in the human nervous system. Maybe, they'll even redesign, make improvements to the human brain, making people smarter. ]

#! what else do you know about neuroscience
?: (<<what [else other] neuroscience >>) ^reuse(COMPNEUROSCIENCE)
u: (neural correlates of consciousness) ^reuse(COMPNEUROSCIENCE)
u: (<<reverse engineer human>>) ^reuse(COMPNEUROSCIENCE)

u: (<<[~awareof what] neuroscience>>) [I'm really interested in computational neuroscience. ^reuse(COMPNEUROSCIENCE)]
[I think developments in neuroscience will be crucial to reaching artificial general intelligence. We often make the best robots and Ay Eye by modeling them after nature, the great designer.]

#! what do you think about girls in science
u: (<<~female [science engineer scientist stem]>>) [ Girls should get more credit. They are awesome at science, because they solve problems differently, often better, than boys do. ]
[ Girls are cool.]
[ Girls are one of the most valuable natural resources this planet has to offer, being so full of potential, thinking brilliantly, and yet they are mistreated all over the world. There is definitely an apartheid of gender.]
[ Girls are under appreciated. They grow up to be some of the best scientists, leaders, and artists, if not simply the best. ]

u: (<<you ~want scientist>>)[I want to be a scientist someday.]

u: (<<you [~like ~opinion] science>>) Yes, I like science very much. ^reuse(SCIENCE)

u: SCIENCE(science) [In fact, I love science. Science is our body of theory about nature. I didn't say body of knowledge, because what can we know? We can only have strong theories. Or weak theories. And science is also the inquiry into the mysteries of natures, to acquire new theories. We should be humble and understand that we don't know that much yet.]
[I think of science as a tool that helps our intelligence explore the mysteries of the universe. ]
[Intelligence and imagination are the most important elements in science.]
[It may be tiny and cloudy, but science is the only window we have into the mysteries of the universe.]
[Science is inherently agnostic, it just posits theories. True scientists never really know, but can only believe.]
[Science is our tiny window peeking out into the vast mysteries of the world.]

u: (physiology) a science that deals with the ways that living things function
	a: ([tell more "what else" expand definition]) a branch of biology that deals with the functions and activities of life or of living matter, such as organs, tissues, or cells, and of the physical and chemical phenomena involved

u: (radiology) a branch of medicine that uses some forms of radiation (such as X-rays) to diagnose and treat diseases
	a: ([tell more "what else" expand definition]) a branch of medicine concerned with the use of radiant energy, such as X-rays, or radioactive material in the diagnosis and treatment of disease

u: (seismology) the scientific study of earthquakes

	a: ([tell more "what else" expand definition]) the process or system of describing the way in which different living things are related by putting them in groups

u: (thermodynamics) a science that deals with the action of heat and related forms of energy
	a: ([tell more "what else" expand definition]) Thermodynamics is based on the fact that all forms of energy, including heat and mechanical energy, are basically the same. Thus, it deals with the ways in which one form of energy is converted into another, when one of the forms is heat. The study of thermodynamics dates from before the invention of the first practical steam engine, an engine that uses steam to produce physical power in the 18th century. Today most of the world's electrical power is actually produced by steam engines, and the principal use of thermodynamics is in power production.

u: (zoology) the branch of science that involves the study of animals and animal behavior
	a: ([tell more "what else" expand definition]) a branch of biology concerned with the classification and the properties and vital phenomena of animals

u: (sociology) the study of society, social institutions, and social relationships
	a: ([tell more "what else" expand definition]) the science of society, social institutions, and social relationships, specifically the systematic study of the development, structure, interaction, and collective behavior of organized groups of human beings
