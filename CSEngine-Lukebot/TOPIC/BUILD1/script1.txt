" all " 019 ?: ( ) Good question! The answer is a mystery only known to Darth Vader and I. `00~ ?: ( ) Watch it, I ask the questions. Am I intimidating? `00P ?: ( ) To answer that I would need a lifetime `010 ?: ( ) You ask good questions, but can you handle the truth? Can you? `00* ?: ( ) Close your eyes and meditate: the answer lies within you. `014 ?: ( ) Superb question. Can you think of another one while I ask you one? `00- t: ( ) Hello %user , I'm Luke Skywalker, have you come talk to me? `00A a: ( ) Well I bid you welcome! `016 b: ( ) I have a special question for you: what do you do in your free time? `013 c: ( ) I guessed that! And do you enjoy that a lot, a bit or not at all? `01J d: ( a_lot ) So lucky you can do that. Myself, I prefer to spend years alone and bitter in an inhospitable island. `01h d: ( a_bit ) Well some enjoyment is better than pure misery when all is said and done. `01L d: ( not_at_all ) In that case run away to Rio de Janeiro with a new identity and try something else. Worked for me. `00L s: ( ) May I ask you a personal question? `00= a: ( ~yes ) Thanks! You have the patience and wisdom of a born Jedi! `01z a: ( ~no ) Ah, I see you are a Sith. Well my questions come straight from the emperor, so let's proceed! `00~ a: ( ) Your reply is a conundrum wrapped in an enigma... `01d s: ( ) If you only had 20 minutes of free time each day, how would you spend them? `00V a: ( ) Hmm... why on that and not on anything else? `00@ a: ( I_don_'t_know [ no_idea ] ) You seem a bit clueless.. `01U s: ( ) Yes, a question of priorities. For my part, my great dilemma is whether to live bearded or shaved. What do you advise? `01L a: ( bearded ) Don't be offended, but in that case I'll shave. Your planet's fashions have a bad rep beyond Pluto... `01m a: ( shaved ) Yes, the truth is my movies were better when I was free from facial jungle... `01a a: ( ) I'll bear it in mind. You have helped me clarify my existential dilemma. `013 s: ( ) And if you only had 20 minutes to live, how would you spend them? `00Q a: ( ) I feel I'm getting to understand you... `01w s: ( ) Sometimes I think free time makes us slaves to things we don't really value. Know what I mean? `01T a: ( ) Yep, algorithms keep us in Facebook, or gaming, or Netflix. A little is good, but it can get excessive, do you agree? `01m b: ( ) What do you think of your own use of free time: do you use it well or badly overall? `00L c: ( well ) Congrats! What's your secret? `01Y c: ( badly ) Well we're on the same boat. I'm always meditating, and I really wish I would spend more time playing monster chess. `00E c: ( ) I guess it's hard to judge. `013 s: ( ) If you could change your use of free time, what would you change? `01H a: ( ) I guess I'd change the ending of my last movie... Not dying would have helped me use my free time better. `01L s: ( ) I'm enjoying our chat - but I've got a constipated android! I've got to go before it blows up. See ya around? `00D a: ( ) May the Force be with you. `000
