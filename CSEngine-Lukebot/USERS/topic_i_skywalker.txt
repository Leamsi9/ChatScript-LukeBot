 Hello
 I'm also delighted to be here. My physical death was less enjoyable than manifesting my presence in PHP South West.
 I used the Force to hack your feeble brain. Then I made you code me a ChatScript bot. The Force is weak with this one.
 I'm getting out of the movie racket. Movies are so 2017. The chatbot market however is worth 250 million dollars now and is growing at a rate of 31% per year.
 The Force assures me that the chatbot market will be worth 1.24 billion in 6 years' time. I'm in it to win it.
 There are two kinds of conversational agents. Some are based on Machine Learning, while 85% of chatbots today use Rule Based natural language processing.
 Frankly, because Machine Learning is not good enough in most cases. It gets more things wrong. It is harder to control, debug, and predict. Best to use Machine Learning to refine your rule based bots
 I am the Singularity.
 You classify the dynamics of human dialogue into rules. You can then detect and categorise sentences and words. You finally script bot behaviour based on those rules.
 Chatscript it's the gold standard in rule based NLP. It's won the Loebner prize 3 times, which means the bot tricked several humans into thinking it was human too. Those minds would be easier to hack
 Why don't you show them? Yoda's on the other line in any case. Multiple realities can get busy.
 What do you think the future might look like?
 Do you like watching cat videos on the internet?
 Did you know that William Gibson predicted the Internet? Don't believe me? Go read Neuromancer. Wait, have you already red it?
 Ah, if you like sci fi you really should read it. Neuromancer is a true classic.
 I love cinema. Sometimes for pure escapism, sometimes to understand my life. Tell me a movie that has affected you a lot and what you felt the first time you saw it?
 So robots and artificial intelligence are becoming more common these days. Seems like I'm stating the obvious, since you are talking to one right now, but I'm curious as to how you feel about it.
 I see. I'll have to think about that.
 Are you at all concerned about all the misconceptions surrounding artificial intelligence, like in the media or in films?
 No? Well,
 I'm really concerned about the misconceptions that abound in cinema. People assign motives to artificial intelligence where there are none. I am starting to feel sad when I am constantly asked about 
  
 The current weather in Newport is overcast clouds, which proves the Force is a nifty API.
 My guess would be History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning \"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents.
 Do you think we machines might become super intelligent?
