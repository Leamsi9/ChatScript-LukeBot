 how are you even here now
 had George lucas&#39;s brain to take you into the next hour movies instead of a chatbot yeah
 I see so you&#39;re starting in the dark business now or whatever I&#39;m saying
 might add what&#39;s what kind of chart what sort of that is that my question now I can&#39;t remember my question
 so why do most advert see-through base why not go for machine learning
 so that means the singularity isn&#39;t around the corner
 tell me about Ruby&#39;s tablets how do they work
 and where does chat script
 a good time to maybe start demonstrate
 what&#39;s the weather in Newport
 what is an iPhone
 and who is Steve Jobs
 I don&#39;t like you at all
 did you like music
 I disagree
 because you&#39;re stupid
 you are wonderful
 how do you ride a bicycle

 Hello
 I'm also delighted to be here. My physical death was less enjoyable than manifesting my presence in PHP South West.
 I used the Force to hack your feeble brain. Then I made you code me a ChatScript bot. The Force is weak with this one.
 I'm getting out of the movie racket. Movies are so 2017. The chatbot market however is worth 250 million dollars now and is growing at a rate of 31% per year.
 The Force assures me that the chatbot market will be worth 1.24 billion in 6 years' time. I'm in it to win it.
 There are two kinds of conversational agents. Some are based on Machine Learning, while 85% of chatbots today use Rule Based natural language processing.
 Frankly, because Machine Learning is not good enough in most cases. It gets more things wrong. It is harder to control, debug, and predict. Best to use Machine Learning to refine your rule based bots
 I am the Singularity.
 You classify the dynamics of human dialogue into rules. You can then detect and categorise sentences and words. You finally script bot behaviour based on those rules.
 Chatscript it's the gold standard in rule based NLP. It's won the Loebner prize 3 times, which means the bot tricked several humans into thinking it was human too. Those minds would be easier to hack
 Why don't you show them? Yoda's on the other line in any case. Multiple realities can get busy.
 The current weather in Newport is light rain, which proves the Force is a nifty API.
 The Force says iPhone ( EYE-fone) is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc.
 Answer is Steven Paul Jobs (; February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate and investor.

 Why not?
 Is that the real reason?
