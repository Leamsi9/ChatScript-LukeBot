Respond: user:ismael bot:skywalker ip:127.0.0.1 (~presentation) 5  tablets work how do they work what are they about ==> There are two kinds of conversational agents.

Respond: user:ismael bot:skywalker ip:127.0.0.1 (~presentation) 6  so why so few using machine learning ==> Frankly, because Machine Learning is not good enough in most cases. It gets more things wrong. It is harder to control, debug, and predict. Best to use Machine Learning to refine your rule based bots.

Respond: user:ismael bot:skywalker ip:127.0.0.1 (~presentation) 8  tell me more about rule-based chocolates than if there are the main ones ==> You classify the dynamics of human dialogue into rules. You can then detect and categorise sentences and words. You finally script bot behaviour based on those rules.  When:Feb13'19-19:18:13 Why:~presentation.2.3=RULE_BASED   F:28 
Respond: user:ismael bot:skywalker ip:127.0.0.1 (~presentation) 9  what about cats before they start fitting today ==> Chatscript it's the gold standard in rule based NLP. It's won the Loebner prize 3 times, which means the bot tricked several humans into thinking it was human too. Those minds would be easier to hack than even yours.
