 Hello ismael, I'm Luke Skywalker, have you come talk to me?
 Well I bid you welcome!
 I have a special question for you: what do you do in your free time?
 I guessed that! And do you enjoy that a lot, a bit or not at all?
 May I ask you a personal question?
 Thanks! You have the patience and wisdom of a born Jedi!
 If you only had 20 minutes of free time each day, how would you spend them?
 Hmm... why on that and not on anything else?
