Respond: user: bot:skywalker ip: (~artificial_intelligence) 23   What is AI ==> So artificial intelligence is a complex system used in computer software to give cognitive properties to a machine. In this way, the machine can think and make decisions similar to a person, by our definition of intelligence. There are methods of artificial intelligence which are based on the design of the human brain, and some, not so much. There are many errors that occur in the human mind that we might not want to replicate. there is no need for more irrational anger in this world. Rather, our aims with our artificial intelligence software is to foster benevolence in all of our personalities, precisely because it is what we need as a society. I think this powerful technology can bring us a much more peaceful era with greater understanding of each other.  When:Feb13'19-05:18:33 Why:~artificial_intelligence.9.0=WHATIS.~control.10.0   F:17

Respond: user: bot:skywalker ip: (~presentation) 6     ==> Frankly, because Machine Learning is not good enough in most cases. It gets more things wrong. It is harder to control, debug, and predict.

Respond: user: bot:skywalker ip: (~presentation) 9     ==> Chatscript it's the gold standard in rule based NLP. It's won the Loebner prize 3 times, which means the bot tricked several humans into thinking it was human too. Those minds would be easier to hack than even yours.
