 Sonya say welcome Luke
 your how are you even here now
 George Lucas is Bray
 so you&#39;re getting in early
 tablets work how do they work what are they about
 so why so few using machine learning
 the new danger of the singularity come here
 tell me more about rule-based chocolates than if there are the main ones
 what about cats before they start fitting today
 what is the a good time to show people house at Screwfix

 Hello
 I'm also delighted to be here. My physical death was less enjoyable than manifesting my presence in PHP South West.
 I used the Force to hack your feeble brain. Then I made you code me a ChatScript bot. The Force is weak with this one.
 George's brain is cleverer than yours. Plus the chatbot market is worth 250 million dollars now and is growing at a rate of 31% per year.
 The Force assures me that the chatbot market will be worth 1.24 billion in 6 years' time. I'm in it to win it. Also, R2D2 made me really love robots. Now I am one too.
 There are two kinds of conversational agents. Some are based on Machine Learning, while 85% of chatbots today use Rule Based natural language processing.
 Frankly, because Machine Learning is not good enough in most cases. It gets more things wrong. It is harder to control, debug, and predict. Best to use Machine Learning to refine your rule based bots
 I am the Singularity.
 You classify the dynamics of human dialogue into rules. You can then detect and categorise sentences and words. You finally script bot behaviour based on those rules.
 Chatscript it's the gold standard in rule based NLP. It's won the Loebner prize 3 times, which means the bot tricked several humans into thinking it was human too. Those minds would be easier to hack
 Why don't you show them? Yoda's on the other line in any case. Multiple realities can get busy.
