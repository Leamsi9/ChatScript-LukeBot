 Hello
 I'm also delighted to be here. My physical death was less enjoyable than manifesting my presence in PHP South West.
 I used the Force to hack your feeble brain, then I made you code me a ChatScript bot. The Force is weak with this one.
 I'm getting out of the movie racket. Movies are so 2017. The chatbot market however is worth 250 million dollars now and is growing at a rate of 31% per year.
 The Force assures me that the chatbot market will be worth 1.24 billion in 6 years' time. I'm in it to win it.
 There are two kinds of conversational agents. Some are based on Machine Learning, while 85% of chatbots today use Rule Based natural language processing.
