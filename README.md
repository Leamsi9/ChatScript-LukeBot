# ChatScript-LukeBot
This is a chatbot demo for PHP South West Meetup: combining PHP, JavaScript (Web Speech Api) and ChatScript to create a chatbot with progressive functionalities.

The GUIs include a basic form to illustrate the simplest implementation, a Reveal.JS slide presentation hooked up to the chatbot for an interactive presentation experience, a speech-enabled GUI and a (WIP) Butler bot to trigger APIs in a conversational medium.
The bot requires ChatScript to be running on a server/locally.
